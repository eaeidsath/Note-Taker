## Description
    
Note Taker makes it easy to take and keep track of notes. This application uses an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

It can be difficult to keep track of important information in an organized manner. This note taker application helps users with that problem by providing a place to easily write notes, see the content of previously saved notes, and then remove notes when they are no longer needed.

Making the back-end of this application helped me become much more familiar with using express.js to host a server. I was able to learn how to use get, post, and delete requests to store new data in a JSON file, retrieve that data for viewing, and then remove select data.
